# Sudoku-solver
A graphical application written in C to solve Sudoku puzzles.
This solver links against SDL2 and SDL2_ttf for the display.
You should be able to easily build this for your target os but will need to have SDL2 and SDL2_ttf on your system.
Or in the same folder as the binaries.
There is a sample makefile included for Linux/Debian systems.
Controls for the app:
arrows to move along the grid, numbers 1-9 to enter a number, number 0 to clear a square, C to clear the whole puzzle
And finally Enter to run the solver.

You can do whatever you want with this code.
Have fun.
